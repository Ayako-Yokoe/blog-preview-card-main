## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

When adjusting the size of the image, we need to set the width to 100% in the media query.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.blog-image {
  width: auto;
  height: 200px;
  ...;
}
```

```css
@media (max-width: 375px) {
  .blog-image {
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

Iâ€™d like to keep working on the minimum code needed to adjust sizes, such as for images and cards.
